 # DriverPass Portfolio Submission

## Reflection

**1. Summary of the DriverPass Project**  
DriverPass was a client-focused project aimed at designing a system to help users prepare for and schedule driving tests. The client wanted a platform that combined educational resources with scheduling tools to streamline the licensing process.

**2. What I Did Well**  
I excelled at gathering clear business requirements and translating them into functional specifications. My documentation was thorough and aligned with the client’s goals.

**3. What I Would Revise**  
I would improve the system design diagrams to better reflect user interactions. Adding more detailed use case scenarios would enhance clarity.

**4. Interpreting User Needs**  
I focused on understanding the client’s pain points and user expectations. By prioritizing features like test scheduling and progress tracking, I ensured the system design was user-centered. Considering user needs is crucial because it drives adoption, satisfaction, and long-term success.
